h2. Overview

RSpec is a Behaviour-Driven Development tool for Ruby programmers. BDD is an approach to software development that combines Test-Driven Development, Domain Driven Design, and Acceptance Test-Driven Planning. RSpec helps you do the TDD part of that equation, focusing on the documentation and design aspects of TDD.

h2. The RSpec Book

The RSpec Book will introduce you to RSpec, Cucumber, and a number of other tools that make up the Ruby BDD family. Replete with tutorials and practical examples, the RSpec Book will help you get your BDD on, taking you from executable requirements to working software that is clean, well tested, well documented, flexible and highly maintainable.

h2. Get Started Now

<pre>
$ gem install rspec
</pre>

<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td width="50%">
<p>
  Start with a very simple example that expresses
  some basic desired behaviour.
</p>

<% coderay(:language => 'ruby') do -%>
# bowling_spec.rb
require 'bowling'

describe Bowling, "#score" do
  it "returns 0 for all gutter game" do
    bowling = Bowling.new
    20.times { bowling.hit(0) }
    bowling.score.should == 0
  end
end
<% end -%>

<p>
  Run the example and watch it fail.
</p>
<pre style="color:red;"># rspec-2
$ rspec bowling_spec.rb

# rspec-1
$ spec bowling_spec.rb 

./bowling_spec.rb:4:
  uninitialized constant Bowling
</pre>
    </td>
    <td width="50%">
<p>
  Now write
  just enough code to make it pass.
</p>

<% coderay do -%>
# bowling.rb
class Bowling
  def hit(pins)
  end

  def score
    0
  end
end
<% end -%>
<p>
Run the example and bask in the joy that is green.
</p>

<pre style="color:green;">
# rspec-2
$ rspec bowling_spec.rb --format nested

# rspec-1

h2. Take very small steps

Don't rush ahead with more code. Instead, add another example and let it guide you to what you have to do next. And don't forget to take time to refactor your code before it gets messy. You should keep your code clean at every step of the way.

h2. Take the first step now!
