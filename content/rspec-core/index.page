h2. Executable Code Examples

RSpec helps you express executable examples of the expected behaviour of your code. Imagine you're talking with a customer requesting software for a bank. Part of that conversation might look like this:

<pre>
You:      Describe an account when it is first created.
Customer: It should have a balance of $0.
</pre>

Here's how we express that conversation in RSpec:

<% coderay do -%>describe Account do
  it "has a balance of $0 when first created" do
    ...
  end
end
<% end -%>

The <code>describe</code> method returns an example group, which contains examples of a particular behaviour of the system that you wish to describe.  The <code>it</code> method returns an example.  When you run this example, RSpec can provide a report like this:

<pre>
Account when first created
  has a balance of $0 when first created
</pre>

h2. before() and after()

You can use <code>before()</code> and/or <code>after()</code> to define code that executes before and after each example or only once per <code>ExampleGroup</code>:

<% coderay do -%>describe Thing do
  before(:all) do
    # This is run once and only once, before all of the examples
    # and before any before(:each) blocks.
  end

  before(:each) do
    # This is run before each example.
  end

  before do
    # :each is the default, so this is the same as before(:each)
  end

  it "does something" do
    ...
  end

  it "does something else" do
    ...
  end

  after(:each) do
    # this is after each example
  end
  
  after do
    # :each is the default, so this is the same as after(:each)
  end

  after(:all) do
    # this is run once and only once after all of the examples
    # and after any after(:each) blocks
  end
  
end
<% end -%>

<b>Warning</b>: The use of <code>before(:all)</code> and <code>after(:all)</code> is generally discouraged because it introduces dependencies between the Examples. Still, it might prove useful for very expensive operations if you know what you are doing.

h2. Helper Methods

You can write helper methods directly within an Example Group:

<% coderay do -%>describe "..." do

  it "..." do
    helper_method
  end
  
  def helper_method
    ...
  end

end
<% end -%>

h2. Reusable Helper Methods

You can include helper methods in multiple ExampleGroups by expressing them within a module, and then including that module in your ExampleGroup:

<% coderay do -%>module AccountExampleHelperMethods
  def helper_method
    ...
  end
end

describe "A new account" do
  include AccountExampleHelperMethods
  before do
    @account = Account.new
  end

  it "should have a balance of $0" do
    helper_method
    @account.balance.should eql(Money.new(0, :dollars))
  end
end
<% end -%>

h2. Shared Example Groups

You can create shared example groups and include those groups into other groups.

Suppose you have some behavior that applies to all editions of your product, both large and small.

First, factor out the "shared" behavior:

<% coderay do -%>
shared_examples_for "all editions" do
  it "should behave like all editions" do
  end
end
<% end -%>

then when you need define the behavior for the Large and Small editions,
reference the shared behavior using the <code>it_should_behave_like()</code>
method.

<% coderay do -%>describe "SmallEdition" do
  it_should_behave_like "all editions"

  it "should also behave like a small edition" do
  end
end

describe "LargeEdition" do
  it_should_behave_like "all editions"

  it "should also behave like a large edition" do
  end
end
<% end -%>

<code>it_should_behave_like</code> will search for an ExampleGroup by its
description string, in this case, "all editions"

All of the following are included from a shared group:

* before(:all)
* before(:each)
* after(:each)
* after(:all)
* all included modules
* all methods

Shared example groups may not extend classes.

Multiple shared example groups may be referenced in one (non-shared) group.

Shared example groups may be included in other shared groups:

<% coderay do -%>
shared_examples_for "All Employees" do
  it "should be payable" do
    @employee.should respond_to(:calculate_pay)
  end
end

shared_examples_for "All Managers" do
  it_should_behave_like "All Employees"
  it "should be bonusable" do
    @employee.should respond_to(:apply_bonus)
  end
end

describe Officer do
  before(:each) do
    @employee = Officer.new
  end

  it_should_behave_like "All Managers"

  it "should be optionable" do
    @employee.should respond_to(:grant_options)
  end
end

$ spec officer_spec.rb

Officer
- should be payable
- should be bonusable
- should be optionable
<% end -%>

h2. Pending Examples

There are three ways to mark an example as "pending."

h3. Leave out the block:

<% coderay do -%>
it "should say foo"
<% end -%>

The output will say PENDING (Not Yet Implemented).

h3. Use the pending method with no block:

<% coderay do -%>
it "should say foo" do
  pending("get the vocal chords working")
  subject.should say("foo")
end
<% end -%>

The output will say PENDING (get the vocal chords working).

h3. Use the pending method with a block:

<% coderay do -%>
it "should say foo" do
  pending("get the vocal chords working") do
    subject.should say("foo")
  end
end
<% end -%>

The output will say PENDING (get the vocal chords working), and the example will fail telling you to it is FIXED as soon as the body of the block raises no errors.
