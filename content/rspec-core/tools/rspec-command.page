When you install the `rspec` gem (or `rspec-core`), it installs the `rspec`
command on your PATH. This command can be used to run specs in one file, several files, all of the files in a directory, or all the files matching a glob pattern:

    rspec          # runs all the files in the spec directory
    rspec spec     # runs all the files in the spec directory
    rspec examples # runs all the files in the examples directory
    rspec spec/widgets/thing_spec.rb    # runs all the examples in the file
    rspec spec/widgets/thing_spec.rb:37 # runs the example or group on line 37
    rspec spec/**/*things*_spec.rb      # runs all files matching the pattern

To learn more, just run:

    rspec --help
